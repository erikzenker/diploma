This chapter evaluates the implementation of the developed
system with respect to performance and flexibility.  The
evaluation has emphasis on determining the overhead of CAL and GVON
configured with the MPI adapter in comparison to plain MPI.

It is expected that the overhead is negligible, because of compile
time optimization. Therefore, it will make no difference exchanging
MPI with a GVON implementation. So that, communication processes will
be as fast as the underlying adapter implementation.

The evaluation is divided in several benchmarks and every benchmark
provides several experiments. Synthetic benchmarks will evaluate
solely single communication methods. Instead, real world benchmarks
will compare the implemented simulations in comparison to equivalent
MPI implementations. Finally, the flexibility benchmark evaluates the
behavior of the system when vertices are redistributed at run-time.
Thereby will experiments vary in amount of peers, number of messages
to send, number of elements to send, and usage of network.

The benchmark system was the HPC system of the Helmholz
Zentrum Dresden Rossendorf (HZDR)\cite{ref:hzdr_cluster}.
%% and the
%% system of the Zentrum für Informationsdienste und Hochleistungsrechnen
%% (ZIH).
A part of the HZDR system is the hypnos linux cluster (Ubuntu 12.04.4
LTS) consisting of two head nodes and more than 150 compute nodes.
The so-called laser nodes combine 4 AMD Interlagos Opterons by 4
sockets on a single mainboard resulting in 64 CPUs per node.  The
Interlagos Opterons 6276 are two Valencia chips on a single die,
whereby 2 core share a 64 KB L1 Cache and a 2 MB L2 Cache. Laser nodes
are interconnected by an Infiniband network. These nodes are utilized
for all synthetic, real simulation, and flexibility benchmarks.

%% In turn, are
%% kepler nodes equipped with 2 Quad-Core Xeon CPUs from Intel clocked by
%% 2,4 GHz. These nodes are used if only a pair of peers is necessary for
%% a benchmark.

%% The ZIH system provides a cluster called taurus. The nodes are
%% equipped each with two Intel Xeon(R) CPU : sandy E5-2690 (8 cores),
%% gpu E5-2450 (cores), west X5660 (6 cores).

The nodes provide their software environment by the module system.
The developed system is compiled with MPI in version 1.8.0 and
g++ 4.8.2.

\section{Synthetic Point-to-Point Benchmark}
This benchmark compares the run-time of fundamental
point-to-point communication operations of MPI with CAL and GVON
operations. It is determined the run-time overhead of the CAL and GVON
in respect to the plain usage of MPI. Since this benchmark does not
represent a real world application, it does only evaluate communication
operations of the particular communication library. The source code of
the experiments is free from any application dependent logic.

Two peers are exchanging data, whereby one peer is the sender and the
other is the receiver. The run-time is measured for sending and
receiving of $n$ messages with $m$ elements.  A single element is set
fixed to a 64 Bit integer.  An experiment will be called send/recv
operation in the further benchmark description. Every send/recv
operation is executed a thousand times and averaged afterwards to reduce
variations in the run-time. An experiment configuration has the
following parameters:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Number of consecutive send/recv operations $n$
  \item Number of elements per send/recv operation $m$
  \item Communicating with or without network
\end{itemize}

\noindent The following experiments, vary a single parameter while the
others stay fixed. This should evaluate the impact of this parameter
with respect to the equivalent MPI implementation.

\subsection*{Increase the Number of Consecutive Send/Recv Operations $n$}
% Checked
This experiment increases the number of consecutive send/recv
operations $n$ from one to ten thousand by a step size of ten. The number of
elements per send/recv operation is restricted to a single
element. The run-time for these consecutive send/recv operations is
measured and averaged to obtain the run-time for a single operation.
The experiment is limited on a single node. Therefore, no network
latency is included in the results.  Figure~\ref{fig:nsend_kepler}
shows the averaged run-time on a single laser node and the according
run-time ration in respect to MPI.

\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{Average run-time of a single send/recv operation and the
    according relative overhead of CAL and GVON with respect to
    MPI. The number of consecutive operations is increased from one to
    ten thousand by a step size of ten. }
  \label{fig:nsend_kepler}
\end{figure}

\noindent The relative overhead of the CAL and GVON stabilizes with
increasing number of send/recv operations.  The CAL adds a constant
average overhead of around two percent per send/recv operation with
respect to MPI through virtual address and context translations. The
GVON adds a constant average overhead of around thirty percent per
send/recv operation.  Since the communication topology of the GVON is
modeled by a graph, containing two nodes connected by a directed edge,
the constantly look up of this graph adds a constant overhead to each
send/recv operation.  Instead, the CAL and MPI are sending and
receiving without the need of a look up from fixed peer addresses.
However, because the graph is not changing during the experiment, it
is sufficient to perform the graph look up only once. Experiments
performed with only one graph look up will be named GVON OGL. The one
look up variant should the reduce the overhead to the similar level of
the CAL. Figure~\ref{fig:nsend_one_lookup_kepler} shows the results of
the experiment that only performs one look up per $n$ send/recv
operation.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\textwidth}

  \caption{The amount of graph look ups is reduced to one look up for
    $n$ send/recv operations.  This reduces the GVON overhead to
    a similar level of the CAL.}
  \label{fig:nsend_one_lookup_kepler}
\end{figure}

\noindent Changing the experiment, reduced the GVON overhead to the
same level of the CAL (around two percent). Nevertheless, the vertex and
graph need to be translated to virtual address and context, so that, a
small overhead in respect to the CAL is still present. It shows that
the graph implementation need to be optimized with regard to look up
of incoming and outgoing edges in the future development.

\subsection*{Increase the Number of Elements per Send/Recv Operation}
This experiment increases the number of elements per send/recv
operation from one to ten thousand by a step size of ten. A single experiment
obtains the average run-time over thousand operations.  The experiment is
limited to execution on a single node. Thus, no network latency is
included in the results. Figure~\ref{fig:nsize_kepler} shows the
averaged run-time of a send/recv operation for a single element and
the run-time ration in respect to MPI on a single kepler node.

  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\textwidth}

  \end{minipage}%
  \caption{Increasing the number of elements per send/recv operations,
    reduces the relative overhead in respect to MPI.}
  \label{fig:nsize_kepler}
\end{figure}

\noindent With increasing number of elements per send/recv operations,
the run-time of CAL and GVON converges with the run-time of MPI. The
average CAL overhead is negligible (less then one percent) and the average
GVON overhead is reduced to around seven percent per send/recv operation. The
last pair of Figures shows, that changing the GVON experiment to a one
graph look up variant, drops the GVON run-time overhead to a
negligible level.

% Checked
\subsection*{Including Network}
The synthetic benchmarks mentioned above were performed only locally on a single node.
Therefore, the run-time results were not influenced by network latency.
The experiments setup is changed to a configuration with two
nodes, whereby the peers are not located on the same node. It is
expected, that the relative overhead of CAL and GVON decreases even
more in contrast to the previous experiments, while the overall
run-time will increase.  A setup of two laser nodes, each hosting one
peer, was selected.  Figure \ref{fig:nsend_network} shows the average
run-time of GVON and CAL in respect to MPI for increasing send/recv
operations including network latency.

  \end{minipage}%
  \caption{Increasing the number of elements per send/recv operations with the influence of network.}
  \label{fig:nsend_network}
\end{figure}

\noindent This experiment resembles more with real world simulation,
because these simulation usually send more than a single element per
communication operation over the network.  The CAL and GVON overhead
of point-to-point operations is in an acceptable range (a~few percent)
for the deployment in real world simulations.

\section{Synthetic Collective Benchmark}
This benchmark compares the run-time of MPI collectives with
equivalent collectives of the CAL and GVON.  To determine the run-time
for a single collective execution, it is averaged over a thousand
executions .  Since, the overhead in respect to MPI should be
determined, only the gather and reduce collective were chosen for
comparison. Other collective operations behave in an analog
manner. The experiments will be executed on a setup with 8 laser
nodes, while the number of peers per nodes will be increased to a
maximum of 64 CPUs.  This will lead to maximum number of 512 CPUs.

% Checked
\subsection*{Gather Collective}
The GVON gather operation is first performed locally for all hosted
vertices of a host. Furthermore, a reordering of the gather results in
vertex index order is performed. An overhead with respect to MPI is
expected.  Figure \ref{fig:gather_laser} shows the average run-time of
a gather collective for increasing number of peers with and without
network.

\section{Real World Simulation Benchmark}
\label{sec:eval:real}
The previous benchmarks evaluated the developed system in a very
synthetic and unreal fashion. But, real world simulation perform
usually calculations in between communication operations. Furthermore,
it is usual to overlap calculations and communication by non-blocking
operations. The Game of Life and N-body simulations were chosen as
examples for such real world simulations. The experiments compare the
implementations on top of the GVON from Section~\ref{sec:implementation} to
equivalent MPI implementations.  Equivalent refers to the same amount of
communication operations and that the same functions are used to calculate
or update the simulation states. A setup with 8 laser nodes is used in
the network case. The number of peers per node is incremented for each
experiment to a maximum of 64. The peers are equally distributed to
the nodes.  Which leads to maximum number of 512 CPUs.

\subsection{Game of Life Benchmark}
This experiment compares the GVON implementation of the Game of Life
from Section~\ref{sec:impl:gol} with an equivalent MPI
implementation. The GoL domain is a rectangular field and the state of
every cell is calculated exclusively by one peer. The average run-time
for a time-step with increasing number of cells is measured. The
run-time is measured with and without network influence.  Figure
\ref{fig:gol_laser} shows the average run-time of a time-step with and
without network.

an implementation based on MPI to an implementation based on the GVON.
Thereby, each body is managed by a peer. Therefore, the number of
peers increases with the number of bodies. Figure
\ref{fig:nbody_laser} shows the averaged run-time of a time-step with
increasing number of bodies with and without network.

\section{Flexibility Benchmark}

This benchmark analyzes the impact of redistribution of hosted
vertices to a varying set of hosts at run-time. A simulation based on the
GVON is executed by a number of hosts $h$. After a period of time steps
$t$, $h$ is decreased by one. The reduction of hosts is perfomed until
all hosted vertices are managed by a single host. From this point $h$
is increased every $t$ time steps by one until $h$ is equal to the
initial $h$.

The Peers are distributed equally over a set of laser nodes and
every peer hosts approximately the same number vertices.

\subsection{GoL Flexibility Benchmark}

The GoL simulation described in Section~\ref{sec:impl:gol} forms the
basis of this experiment.  The simulation is started with 256 peers
and the game field contains 8000 cells. The vertices of the modeled
GoL graph is distributed by round robin to the peers.  The number of
hosts is decreased by one every ten time steps until the number of
hosts is equal to one. From this point the experiment increases the
number of hosts by one every ten time steps until the number of peers
is equal to 256. Figure~\ref{fig:gol_flexi_laser} shows the
average run-time of a single GoL time step whereby the number of hosts
are varied.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{plots/50_gol_flexi_laser}
  \label{fig:gol_flexi_laser}
  \caption{Average time per time step with a varying number of
    hosts. First, the number of hosts is decreased. Second, the number
    of hosts is increased.}
\end{figure}

\noindent Reducing the number of hosts means that the remaining hosts are
responsible for more hosted vertices. Therefore, the run-time should increase
with decreasing number of hosts.  But differently then expected, the
average run-time decreases with the decreasing number of hosts at the
beginning of the simulation. Therefore, less peers can also imply more
data locality which further implies a faster access to the state of
neighboring cells.

The average time per time step reaches its minimum at 64 hosts. This
point defines a distribution of vertices where the hosts are saturated
with vertices.  Decreasing the number of hosts even more only
increases the run-time. The maximum is reached when the whole
simulation is calculated by a single host.  Increasing the number of
hosts from a single host back to 256 hosts shows symmetrical behavior.
